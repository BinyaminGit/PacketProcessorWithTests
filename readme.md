A Python project with software verification, performance testing.

Project Overview
The project will simulate a "**Network Packet Processor**"

My verification tool will:
1. Conduct unit tests to verify the functionality of each packet processing function.
2. Perform performance benchmarks on these packet processing functions.
3. Include a GitHub Actions YAML configuration file for automated 4. build and test pipeline (demonstrating my knowledge in CI tools).


## Prerequisites
1. Python 3.x
2. Pytest: for testing
3. Pytest-benchmark: for performance testing
Install using pip:
```
pip install pytest pytest-benchmark
```

## Project Structure
1. 'packet_processor.py': Simulates a simple network packet processor.
2. 'test_packet_processor.py': Includes both functional and performance tests.
3. '.github/workflows/main.yml': GitHub Actions configuration for CI.


##Instructions
1. Create a new GitHub repository and clone it.
2. Add these files into the repository.
3. Push the code to GitHub.
4. Go to your GitHub repository, navigate to 'Actions', and see your tests running automatically


The code consists of two main parts: a module for processing network packets (packet_processor.py) and a set of unit tests for that module (test_packet_processor.py).

packet_processor.py
This file simulates some basic operations you might perform on network packets.

checksum(packet): Takes a "packet" (a list of integers in this example) and returns its checksum (the sum of all integers in the packet).

encrypt(packet, key): Encrypts the packet using XOR encryption with the given key. XOR is a simple encryption method where each element in the packet is bitwise XORed with the key.

decrypt(packet, key): Decrypts an encrypted packet using XOR decryption with the same key used for encryption.

validate(packet): Validates a packet by checking that all its values are non-negative integers.

drop_invalid_packets(packet_list): Takes a list of packets and returns only the valid ones.

add_headers(packet, headers): Adds headers (a list of integers) to the given packet.

remove_headers(packet, header_length): Removes headers of a given length from the packet.

test_packet_processor.py
This file contains unit tests and performance benchmarks for the packet_processor.py functions.

test_checksum(): Checks that the checksum of [1, 2, 3] is 6.

test_encrypt(): Checks that encrypting [1, 2, 3] with a key of 2 produces [3, 0, 1].

test_decrypt(): Checks that decrypting [3, 0, 1] with a key of 2 gives back [1, 2, 3].

test_validate(): Checks that [1, 2, 3] is a valid packet while [-1, 2, 3] is not.

test_drop_invalid_packets(): Checks that from a list of packets [[1, 2, 3], [-1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], it only keeps the valid ones: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]].

test_add_headers(): Checks that headers [0, 0] are correctly added to the packet [1, 2, 3] to make [0, 0, 1, 2, 3].

test_remove_headers(): Checks that headers of length 2 are correctly removed from the packet [0, 0, 1, 2, 3] to get [1, 2, 3].

There are also performance tests (benchmarks) for the checksum, encrypt, and decrypt functions. These tests measure how long these functions take to process large packets.

By having this kind of modular, well-tested code, you demonstrate best practices in software engineering, which is likely to impress potential employers.
